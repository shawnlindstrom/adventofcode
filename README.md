# Advent of Code
## My solutions to the 2015 Advent of Code challenges.
### A Few Notes
These challenges ranged from fun to frustrating depending upon my current understanding of how to solve a given
day's exercises. Please bear in mind that these are coding challenges meant to achieve the objective of solving
the puzzle rather than solving real world problems and do no reflect the manner in which I would implement them
in a production application. For example, the inline comments are for the benefit of the reader and closures
were used to make consuming input and returning the output of day parts more convenient.

### Questions? Comments?
Let me know if you have any suggestions about how I could improve upon any of the solutions presented. The solutions
I arrived at reflect the way I would go about solving each problem and I'm sure there are many other ways each
could be approached.
